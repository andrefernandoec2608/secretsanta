# 🎁 Secret Santa App

A simple and fun **Secret Santa** generator built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
This app randomly assigns Secret Santa pairs among a list of participants — making sure that **no one gets themselves!** 🎄

It runs locally on your computer, directly in your web browser — no server or account setup required. 💻

## 🧑‍💻 Installation Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Python
Make sure **Python** is installed on your computer. You can check this by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2️⃣ Install Streamlit
Once Python is ready, install **Streamlit** (you only need to do this once):

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

---

## ✅ Verify the installation

Check that Python and pip are available:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

Optional — confirm Streamlit is installed:

```bash
streamlit --version
```

---

## 🚀 Running the application

1. Download or place the file `secret_santa_app.py` inside a folder of your choice.  
2. Open a terminal in that same folder.  
3. Run the app with:

```bash
streamlit run secret_santa_app.py
```

Streamlit will automatically open your default web browser showing the app interface. 🎅✨

**Default URL:** `http://localhost:8501/`

## ⚠️ Important Note

Do **not close the terminal** while the app is running — that console process keeps the Streamlit application alive. Close the terminal only after you stop the app.

To stop the app, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
